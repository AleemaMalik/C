In this lab I had four goals:

1: Implement preemptive threading, in which simulated "timer interrupts" cause the system to switch from one thread to another.

2: Iplement thread_sleep and thread_wakeup scheduling functions. These functions will enable implementing blocking mutual exclusion and synchronization.

3: Use the thread_sleep and thread_wakeup functions to implement thread_wait, which will block a thread until a target thread has finished executing.

4: Implement blocking locks for mutual exclusion, and condition variables for synchronization.
